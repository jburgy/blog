// Shared, Worker-side half of running a classic (blocking `read()`) WASI
// command in the browser. A program written assuming it owns stdin/stdout
// gets them wired to a `uwasi.SharedInputChannel`, so `fd_read` genuinely
// blocks (via `Atomics.wait`) until the host thread supplies more input,
// instead of returning EOF whenever nothing happens to be buffered yet.
//
// Must run on a thread that allows blocking `Atomics.wait` — a Worker, never
// a browser main thread (see the host side, `SharedInputChannel.push`/
// `close`, wired up directly from `uwasi` on whichever page embeds this).
// Node's single thread allows blocking waits too, which is what makes this
// module directly testable without actually spinning up a Worker.
//
// Imported from the esm.sh CDN rather than a bare `'uwasi'` specifier: this
// module is loaded inside a `type: "module"` Worker in production (see
// worker.js), and import maps are not reliably honored for worker module
// graphs the way they are for the document's own (see forth/web/index.html,
// which only ever imports on the main thread). vitest resolves the same URL
// back to the local package — see vitest.config.ts.

// ("unexpected errno: 52") instead of that fallback. Answering ESPIPE (WASI
// errno 70) for stdio's character-device fds makes the fallback happen, the
// same as a real OS would for an unseekable fd. Scoped to fds 0-2: this
// module has no filesystem feature (no useFS/useMemoryFS) yet, but a future
// one would add real, seekable files on higher fds, which must keep seeing

// uwasi's useStdio's fd_read (via ReadableTextProxy.readv) tries to
// completely fill the requested buffer, retrying `stdin()` until it can or
// hits true EOF. That's wrong for a classic POSIX read(): it's fine to
// return less than asked for, and these guests rely on exactly that —
// jonesforth's TIB refill (like 5th.c's key()) always requests a fixed 4096
// bytes regardless of how much input is actually left. Preamble files are
// essentially never an exact multiple of that, so the final, naturally
// short read makes readv() retry forever on a channel that's meant to stay
// open for more interactive input — a hang, not a crash, which is why it
// looks like fd_write is simply never reached (execution is stuck inside
// the *previous* fd_read). Hand-roll fd_read instead, short reads and all;
// useStdio still covers fd_write/fd_fdstat_get/etc., which never have this
// problem (writev() just writes whatever it's given, no retry loop).

    // engine side effect of Atomics.wait pumping the agent cluster's pending
    // cross-thread messages. Without it, a guest that never genuinely blocks
    // (every fd_read is satisfied from input pushed up front, like
    // jonesforth's/5th's preamble) runs `_start` to completion in one
    // uninterrupted JS turn, and every `onOutput` postMessage queues up
    // behind it instead of reaching the main thread as it's produced — so a
    // real browser never repaints until the run is already over. Confirmed
    // needed in Chromium; harmless in Node (worker_threads already pumps
    // fine). If this turns out to be too fragile across engines, the robust
    // fix is reinstating a real request/response round trip per read, like
    // the original hand-rolled implementation this module replaced.
