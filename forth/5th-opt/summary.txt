PARAMETER ORDERING ANALYSIS FOR 5th.c
=====================================

Baseline (Original):
  env, sp, rsp, ip, target  →  641 mov instructions

Optimized orderings tested:
  sp, rsp, ip, env, target  →  640 mov instructions ⭐ BEST
  ip, sp, rsp, env, target  →  641 mov instructions
  rsp, sp, ip, env, target  →  641 mov instructions
  env, sp, ip, rsp, target  →  641 mov instructions
  ip, env, sp, rsp, target  →  643 mov instructions
  env, ip, sp, rsp, target  →  643 mov instructions
  ip, sp, env, rsp, target  →  641 mov instructions
  rsp, ip, sp, env, target  →  643 mov instructions

WINNER: sp, rsp, ip, env, target
Improvement: 1 fewer mov instruction (641 → 640)

X86-64 ABI Register Mapping:
  Current (env, sp, rsp, ip, target):
    rdi = env (struct interp_t *)
    rsi = sp (intptr_t *)
    rdx = rsp (union instr_t **)
    rcx = ip (union instr_t *)
    r8 = target (union instr_t *)

  Optimal (sp, rsp, ip, env, target):
    rdi = sp (intptr_t *)         ← moved from rsi to rdi
    rsi = rsp (union instr_t **)  ← moved from rdx to rsi
    rdx = ip (union instr_t *)    ← moved from rcx to rdx
    rcx = env (struct interp_t *) ← moved from rdi to rcx
    r8 = target (union instr_t *) ← stays in r8

KEY INSIGHT:
sp and rsp are the most frequently accessed parameters in hot code paths
(NEXT macro uses them heavily in every tail call). By placing them in 
rdi/rsi (the first two parameter registers), the compiler can generate
more efficient code with fewer register reallocation moves.
